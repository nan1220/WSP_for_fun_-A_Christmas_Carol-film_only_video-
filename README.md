# Description
I was recommended to watch this movie when I felt a bit down. The next day I was trying to find the movide resource and then got a web.  
I prefer to watch it in a rather-clean web or directly in a video player. For that reason, I managered to abstract the video.

This is the original resource:[unmodified original webpage](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KpbhNIiGKJX8JIzdKeIO-w)  
There might be some error in its original html content. So before modifying it, some of my methods failed to abstract it. However, after modifying it, the progress was much more smooth.

# Final movie
I finally made it to get the pure video and run it in browser.  
Sadly, the following day after I managered to get the access dicrectly to the video, it seems that the video resource detected my request and refused my request. XP  
But luckly, I have downloaded the video when I accessed to the origial video resource before it closed.  
So here, via this link, u can also watch the movie, if u are interested:
